- Prior to being stored on the cloud, the information provided by the donor must first be verified. 

- To create a user-friendly Interface, that helps the users to
interact with the application effectively. 

- To create an awareness about importance of plasma donation among the peoples, a plasma
donation awareness program may be conducted seasonally across various locations. 

- Once the donor has agreed to the request and is prepared to donate, a channel of
communication between the donor and seeker must be established in order to facilitate
communication between them.

- Whenever the user/seeker requests for the particular plasma type, then concerned plasma type
donors will receives the notification regarding the requirement. 

- Only those who have registered and are willing to donate blood will have access to the service. 

- The need for plasma will be communicated to the donor using GPS and a messenger, and the
donors will then make the plasma available to the needy. 

- Those who want to donate their plasma and have a history of covid-19 positivity can register
under the covid-19 plasma donation section.

- The system shouldn't have to rely solely on selfless donors and should work with blood banks to
increase plasma availability. 

- People who want to volunteer and donate plasma can do so by registering with the application. 

- The seekers who are in need of plasma are capable of making a request. 

- A central database called "E-Blood Bank Database" is created by compiling data from various
sources such as voluntary blood donors, blood banks, the NSS, non-governmental organizations, and
hospitals.

- Instead of using a monolithic architecture, the entire application must be developed using a
microservices architecture to reduce the risk of a single point of failure and facilitate easy scaling. 

- The application must be able to locate donors in the area closest to the request once it has been
made. If no donors are found in the area closest to the request, or if no donors are found locally, the
application may search further afield. 

- As per the plasma requirement, user can quickly get a notification from the blood bank within their
nearest location. 

- Since cloud-based services allow for global, immediate access to donor data and location, they
can be crucial in the delivery of emergency plasma.
